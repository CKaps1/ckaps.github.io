I am a third-year student in the <a href='https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/'>Cheriton School of Computer Science</a> with a passion for emerging technologies and problem-solving. With a strong foundation from my studies and hobbies, I enjoy exploring new technologies and software projects. I am motivated, detail-oriented, and thrive in collaborative and fast-paced environments. I am eager to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects. Outside of programming, I love table tennis, golfing and rock climbing.

I possess a pronounced technical background in various technologies and infrastructures such as Git, React, and AWS. I often work with SQL, Python, and SaaS. I am equipped with unique interpersonal skills that will be appreciated at Stripe. My greatest strengths come from my background in writing data structures and algorithms for speed and memory optimizations. Through internships, personal projects, and contest programming, I have developed hands-on experience in collaborative software development environments.

If you are interested in some of my ramblings, I suggest reading my [blog page](/blog).
